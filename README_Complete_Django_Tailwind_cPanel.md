# How to Deploy a Django App with Tailwind CSS on cPanel using the Python Setup App

This guide provides a **step-by-step walkthrough** to deploy a Django project (with Tailwind CSS) on a cPanel-based hosting environment using the **Python App Setup tool**.

---

## ✅ Requirements

### Tools Needed:
- Access to a hosting provider with **cPanel** that supports **Python App Setup** (e.g., ProtozoaHost, A2 Hosting)
- Your **Django + Tailwind** project (e.g., from GitHub)
- A local development environment with Python and Node.js (for Tailwind build)
- Basic understanding of terminal commands

### Django Assumptions:
- Django version: 3.x to 5.x
- Tailwind CSS is compiled locally (cPanel does not support Node.js)

...

## 🏑 You're Done!

Your Django app with Tailwind CSS is now **live on cPanel**, fully backed by a MySQL database, secured `.env` config, and served static assets reliably via WhiteNoise.
